This is submitted for the completion of AIML440 Directed individual study as part of the Master of Artificial Intelligence programme at Victoria University of Wellington. This reports will have three sections. Firstly an Introduction of reinforcement learning and basic algorithms. Secondly I will evaluate modern algorithms. Lastly I will describe a new algorithm and compare it to the state of the art models.
