% Current options are:

\begin{abstract}
This is submitted for the completion of AIML440 Directed individual study as part of the Master of Artificial Intelligence programme at Victoria University of Wellington. This report contains three things. Firstly an Introduction of reinforcement learning and basic RL algorithms. Secondly an introduction and explanation of modern and state of the art algorithms including experimental results. Lastly I propose a new algorithm Dynamic-Sunrise which is an extension of Sunrise to dynamically mutate and remove agents from the ensemble. Basic experiments are run and show the performance of the algorithm is similar to Sunrise but the diversity of the ensemble is maintained throughout learning. Further work would be needed to fully evaluate the potential and benefits of dynamic ensembles in the continuous control reinforcement learning setting.
