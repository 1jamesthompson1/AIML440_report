To support the development of new Algorithms I thought it would be prudent to have a special section that I can quickly write up some proposals.

This directory effectively corresponds with [this](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/AIML440_code/tree/9d56f5580df520e4023300704183ec14a32e5f0a/my-algorithm-implementation) implementation directory.

There are two algorithm that I have an idea for:

- Dynamic Sunrise (DSunrise): An extension of the Sunrise algorithm that maintains the diversity of the ensemble throughout training by dynamically mutating the ensemble members.
- SnAC (SnAC): An extension of the SAC algorithm that uses an ensemble of actors with a shared critic. Its goal was to improve the exploration of the algorithm however the implementation was never completed.
