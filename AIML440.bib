  abstract = {Reinforcement learning agents are adaptive, reactive, and self-supervised. The aim of this dissertation is to extend the state of the art of reinforcement learning and enable its applications to complex robot-learning problems. In particular, it focuses on two issues. First, learning from sparse and delayed reinforcement signals is hard and in general a slow process. Techniques for reducing learning time must be devised. Second, most existing reinforcement learning methods assume that the world is a Markov decision process. This assumption is too strong for many robot tasks of interest. This dissertation demonstrates how we can possibly overcome the slow learning problem and tackle non-Markovian environments, making reinforcement learning more practical for realistic robot tasks: (1) Reinforcement learning can be naturally integrated with artificial neural networks to obtain high-quality generalization, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Neural networks are used in this dissertation, and they generalize effectively even in the presence of noise and a large of binary and real-valued inputs. (2) Reinforcement learning agents can save many learning trials by using an action model, which can be learned on-line. With a model, an agent can mentally experience the effects of its actions without actually executing them. Experience replay is a simple technique that implements this idea, and is shown to be effective in reducing the number of action executions required. (3) Reinforcement learning agents can take advantage of instructive training instances provided by human teachers, resulting in a significant learning speedup. Teaching can also help learning agents avoid local optima during the search for optimal control. Simulation experiments indicate that even a small amount of teaching can save agents many learning trials. (4) Reinforcement learning agents can significantly reduce learning time by hierarchical learning--they first solve elementary learning problems and then combine solutions to the elementary problems to solve a complex problem. Simulation experiments indicate that a robot with hierarchical learning can solve a complex problem, which otherwise is hardly solvable within a reasonable time. (5) Reinforcement learning agents can deal with a wide range of non-Markovian environments by having a memory of their past. Three memory architectures are discussed. They work reasonably well for a variety of simple problems. One of them is also successfully applied to a nontrivial non-Markovian robot task.The results of this dissertation rely on computer simulation, including (1) an agent operating in a dynamic and hostile environment and (2) a mobile robot operating in a noisy and non-Markovian environment. The robot simulator is physically realistic. This dissertation concludes that it is possible to build artificial agents than can acquire complex control policies effectively by reinforcement learning.},

ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.},

In this paper, we introduce a simple model-free algorithm, Randomized Ensembled Double Q-Learning (REDQ), and show that its performance is just as good as, if not better than, a state-of-the-art model-based algorithm for the MuJoCo benchmark. Moreover, REDQ can achieve this performance using fewer parameters than the model-based method, and with less wall-clock run time. REDQ has three carefully integrated ingredients which allow it to achieve its high performance: (i) a UTD ratio {$>>$} 1; (ii) an ensemble of Q functions; (iii) in-target minimization across a random subset of Q functions from the ensemble. Through carefully designed experiments, we provide a detailed analysis of REDQ and related model-free algorithms. To our knowledge, REDQ is the first successful model-free DRL algorithm for continuous-action spaces using a UTD ratio {$>>$} 1.},

Our algorithm builds on Double Q-learning, by taking the minimum value between a pair of critics to limit overestimation. We draw the connection between target networks and overestimation bias, and suggest delaying policy updates to reduce per-update error and further improve performance.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy; that is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as challenging real-world tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

  abstract = {Policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) have successfully tackled a broad range of high-dimensional continuous RL problems, including many challenging robotic control problems. These algorithms can be largely divided into two categories, i.e., on-policy algorithms and off-policy algorithms. Off-policy deep RL (DRL) algorithms enjoy better sample efficiency than and often outperform on-policy algorithms. However, cutting-edge off-policy algorithms still suffer from the low-quality estimation of policy gradients, resulting in compromised learning performance and high sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings. To address this issue, we propose a new concept of robust policy gradient (RPG). Driven by RPG, this paper further develops a new policy ensemble gradient (PEG) algorithm for DRL, inspired by the recent success of several ensemble DRL algorithms. PEG efficiently and effectively estimates RPG by using multiple policy gradients obtained respectively from several off-policy base learners in an ensemble. The estimated RPG is then utilized for training all base learners simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on six Mujoco benchmark problems. Compared to four state-of-the-art off-policy algorithms and four cutting-edge ensemble policy gradient algorithms, our new PEG algorithm achieved highly competitive stability, performance and sample efficiency. Further analysis shows that PEG is insensitive to varied hyper-parameter settings, confirming the positive role of RPG in building reliable and effective off-policy DRL algorithms.},

The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.},

The game of Dota 2 presents novel challenges for AI systems such as long time horizons, imperfect information, and complex, continuous state-action spaces, all challenges which will become increasingly central to more capable AI systems. OpenAI Five leveraged existing reinforcement learning techniques, scaled to learn from batches of approximately 2 million frames every 2 seconds. We developed a distributed training system and tools for continual training which allowed us to train OpenAI Five for 10 months.

In this paper, we present results from our work reproducing the results of the DQN paper. We highlight key areas in the implementation that were not covered in great detail in the original paper to make it easier for researchers to replicate these results, including termination conditions and gradient descent algorithms. Finally, we discuss methods for improving the computational performance and provide our own implementation that is designed to work with a range of domains, and not just the original Arcade Learning Environment [Bellemare et al., 2013].},

  abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input.

Accordingly, reward is enough to drive behaviour that exhibits abilities studied in natural and artificial intelligence, including knowledge, learning, perception, social intelligence, language, generalisation and imitation. This is in contrast to the view that specialised problem formulations are needed for each ability, based on other signals or objectives. Furthermore, we suggest that agents that learn through trial and error experience to maximise reward could learn behaviour that exhibits most if not all of these abilities, and therefore that powerful reinforcement learning agents could constitute a solution to artificial general intelligence.},

We evaluate our approach on several indoor and outdoor terrains which are known to be challenging for classical model-based controllers. We observe the robot to be able to learn walking gait consistently on all of these terrains. Finally, we evaluate our design decisions in a simulated environment.},

Although such temporal-difference methods have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained poorly understood. Here we prove their convergence and optimality for special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods. For most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods require less memory and less peak computation than conventional methods and they produce more accurate predictions. We argue that most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference methods can be applied to advantage.},

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.},
